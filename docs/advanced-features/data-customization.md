# Data Customization

Fine-tune how individual metrics or groups of metrics are displayed using overrides and formatting rules.

## What you'll find here

- **Overrides** - Apply custom thresholds, units, and settings to specific metrics using regex patterns
- **Value Formatting** - Control how metric values are formatted and displayed

These tools give you precise control over metric presentation, allowing different metrics to display in the most appropriate way for your use case.
