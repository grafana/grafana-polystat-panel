# Layout Guide

Learn best practices for organizing and arranging metrics in your Polystat panel for optimal readability and monitoring effectiveness.

## Layout strategies

When displaying multiple metrics, consider these layout approaches:

- **Auto layout** - Let the panel automatically size and arrange polygons for best fit
- **Manual grid** - Specify exact rows and columns for consistent positioning
- **Display limits** - Control how many metrics are shown to avoid overcrowding

## Tips for effective layouts

- Use auto-sizing for dashboards that will be viewed at different resolutions
- Set manual rows/columns when you need consistent positioning across panel updates
- Apply display limits to focus on the most important metrics
- Consider using composites to reduce visual clutter when monitoring many related metrics

The right layout strategy depends on your monitoring needs and dashboard design.
